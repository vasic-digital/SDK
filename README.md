# Boba SDK for Android

Develop the IPC extension applications for the `Boba for Android` project or your 
own Android application. 

SDK provides mechanism for application extensibility through the development of IPC 
Extension applications.

The Client and the Extension applications talk to each other using the IPC so the additional 
extensibility is achieved. Client sends the request, Extension acts upon it and responds.
